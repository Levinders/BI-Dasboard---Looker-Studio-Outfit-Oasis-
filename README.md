# BI-Dashboard - Looker Studio (Outfit Oasis)
This is part 2 of my analysis project submission

# Overview & Details
Outfit Oasis is a fictitious prominent retail store specializing in Beauty, Electronics, and Clothing. With a growing customer base of 150, the company has built a reputation for high-quality products and exceptional service.

This project marks the completion of the sales and customer analysis requested by Chloe, the Sales Manager, to drive strategic decisions for the company’s 2025 marketing and operational plans.

By leveraging historical data from 2022 – 2023, I identified key trends, customer behavior patterns, sales performance metrics, and growth opportunities for Outfit Oasis.
